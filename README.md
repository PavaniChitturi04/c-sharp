# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C#

This project is a simple console-based implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game, developed using C#. The game supports a two-player mode where two players can play against each other by entering their moves, and the system will check for winning conditions or a draw.

## Features

- **Two-player mode**: The game alternates between Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).
- **Visual board representation**: The game board updates dynamically after each move.
- **Win/Draw conditions**: The game checks if any player has won or if it results in a draw.
- **Interactive prompts**: The game asks players to enter their move and shows a message if the move is invalid.

## Gameplay Instructions

1. At the start of the game, Player 1 is assigned 'X' and Player 2 is assigned 'O'.
2. Players take turns selecting a position on the board (1â€“9) to place their mark (X or O).
3. The game checks after every move if there is a winner or if the game ends in a draw.
4. Once the game ends, it will announce the result: either which player has won or if it's a draw.
